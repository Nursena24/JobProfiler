This app is based on a biobank study of nearly 70,000 people carried out by the University of Tartu. The study, lead by Kätlin Anni (katlin.anni@ut.ee), provided detailed personality trait profiles for 263 occupations. This app allows anyone to compare their personality traits to the average trait profiles of these occupations.

The app is developed by Emma Mõttus (emma.mottus@ut.ee) and René Mõttus (rene.mottus@ed.ac.uk).
