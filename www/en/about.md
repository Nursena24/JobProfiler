This app is based on a biobank <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-38154-001.html" target="_blank">study</a> of nearly 70,000 people carried out by the University of Tartu. The study, lead by Kätlin Anni (katlin.anni@ut.ee), provided <a href="https://apps.psych.ut.ee/JobProfiles/" target ="_blank">detailed personality trait profiles for 263 occupations</a>. This app allows anyone to compare their personality traits to the average trait profiles of these occupations.

The app is developed by Emma Mõttus (emma.mottus@ut.ee) and René Mõttus (rene.mottus@ed.ac.uk).

For support or feedback, please email jobprofiler@ut.ee.

The app's use for research has been approved by the University of Edinburgh PPLS Research Ethics Committee (no 4-2425/2).
