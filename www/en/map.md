#### Why am I here?

This map illustrates the diversity among people. 

Each dot represents the average responses of many people doing one job. But people doing the same jobs can have very different personalities. This means:

-  Many people's responses are very different from the average for their job. This is expected
-  Most jobs lie in the middle of the map, while individuals can be scattered anywhere across the map. This is because jobs vary less amongst themselves than people vary amongst themselves 
-  Therefore, you may find yourself far from any job. Many people do, reflecting greater personality diversity among people than among jobs
-  Still, the jobs closer to you on the map tend to have people more similar to your personality than jobs further away from you
