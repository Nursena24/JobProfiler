We provide three types of feedback based on your responses:
* Jobs with incumbents who tend to provide the most and least similar responses to yours
* A personality trait map, showing where your responses put you among jobs
* Your Big Five personality traits

**And remember**

* Psychological testing is never perfectly accurate
* Each job can be successfully done by different people and the differences between average people doing different jobs are small
* Your personality traits may be different from any one job's average. This is because jobs' average traits tend to be similar, while people are more different among themselves
* Having personality traits dissimilar to the average of those doing a job does not mean being unfit for the job
